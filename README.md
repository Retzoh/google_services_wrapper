Google services, python framework
=================================

This repository is a pip package acting as a high-level wrapper for the
[google api client](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/get_started).

It provides high-level access (ex `drive.create_folder(folder_name)`)
to some functionalities of the
[drive](https://developers.google.com/drive/api) and
[gmail](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api) apis.

It is also a collection of working use cases for those apis.
This is useful since the official google documentation for the apis
is difficult to use in practice because of incomplete examples.
